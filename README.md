# Analyzing NBA Data From the Last Decade with SQL
## Introduction
We have been given a dataset containing comprehensive game stats, player stats, and team stats for every game from the 2013-14 season up until the 2022-23 season. This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com. [NBA Boxscore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukedip/nba-boxscore-dataset) Our goal is to ensure the data is clean and then explore and gather insights about the data, using some complex SQL queries. The core focus of this analysis is related to the 3-pointer and it's relationship to winning games. 
#### Questions
What was the average number of 3s taken per game by a team in the 2013-2014 season?

What was the average number of 3s taken per game by a player in the 2022-2023 season?

Which team has taken the most 3s across this entire decade? What is their winning percentage?

Do more 3PA (3-point attempts) lead to higher TS% (True shooting percentage)? 

What is the correlation between 3PA and winning games for the most recent season?

#### Dashboard
After looking into these questions, our next goal will be to create a dashboard that, not only presents our findings but allows one to track these statistics in real time. We will migrate our data from SQL to PowerBI and then build the dashboard there.
